Q.3• What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the layout and presentation of HTML and XML documents. 
CSS2 and CSS3 are two different versions of this language, with CSS3 being the most recent and advanced version.
Here is a more detailed comparison of the differences between CSS2 and CSS3:

Selectors

CSS2 supports a limited number of selectors such as type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and descendant selectors.
CSS3, on the other hand, includes a wider range of selectors, including attribute selectors, sibling selectors, and pseudo-classes, among others.
This allows developers to more precisely target specific elements on a page.

Box model

The box model defines how HTML elements are displayed on a webpage.
CSS2 has a limited number of properties for controlling the box model, such as margin, padding, and border.
CSS3 introduces several new properties such as border-radius, box-shadow, and box-sizing, which allow for 
greater control over the size and appearance of elements on a page.

Typography

CSS3 offers several new properties that allow for greater control over typography. For example, it includes new properties
for text decoration, such as text-shadow and text-overflow, as well as new font properties, such as font-stretch and font-feature-settings.
Additionally, CSS3 introduces new features for working with web fonts, such as the @font-face rule.

Media queries

Media queries allow developers to apply different styles to a webpage based on the device it is being viewed on. 
CSS2 has limited support for media queries, while CSS3 introduces a much wider range of features for creating responsive designs.
This includes new media query properties such as min-width, max-width, and device-width, which allow developers to create styles 
that adapt to different screen sizes.

Transitions and animations

CSS3 includes new properties for creating animations and transitions. For example, it includes the transition property, which allows 
developers to create smooth transitions between different states of an element, and the animation property, which allows developers
to create more complex animations.
Overall, CSS3 provides developers with a wider range of tools for creating advanced layouts and effects on a webpage. However, it's important to note that not all browsers support all CSS3 features, so developers may need to provide fallbacks or alternative styles for older browsers.





Q.4• Name a few CSS style components

Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. 
For example, font-size , width , background-color .
Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.




Q.5• What do you understand by CSS opacity? 

The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element.

The opacity-level describes the transparency-level,
where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through,
and 0 is completely transparent.





Q.6 • How can the background color of an element be changed? 

 The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:

.background-color
.background-image
.background-repeat
.background-attachment
.background-position
.background (shorthand property)




Q.7  • How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? 

In this article, we will see how an image repetition of the backup is controlled in CSS. 
This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.

The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. 
It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

syntax=> background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;







Q.8 • What is the use of the background-position property? 

The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.

Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.




Q.9• Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 

The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.Example
A background-image that will not scroll with the page (fixed):

example->

body {
background-image: url("img_tree.gif");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-attachment: fixed;
 }

Q.10 • Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 

The background-color property sets the background color of an element.
The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).

Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.
syntex=>body {background-color: coral;}


Q,11 How to center block elements using CSS1? 

To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;

    Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.

    The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two
    margin:

syntax= .center {
margin: auto;
width: 60%;
border: 3px solid #73AD21;
padding: 10px;
}  </style>
